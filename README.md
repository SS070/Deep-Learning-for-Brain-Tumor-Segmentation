# Deep-Learning-for-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation
This project focuses on brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans using deep learning techniques. The objective is to accurately identify and segment tumor regions within brain images at the pixel level. The model employs a CNN architecture for semantic segmentation (U-Net) to produce binary or multi-class masks corresponding to the tumor regions.
